             <p>Tesla had over 300 patents, some of which have magically disappeared. He is most notably
             known for coming up with the AC electric system, which we still use today. He also created the Tesla coil,
           which is used in numerous electronics. Tesla was also involved in helping design phosphorescent lamps which where
         highly efficient and ahead of their time.</p>

          <div class="tab-panel" id="tab-2">
              <p> Elon Musk is a south African-born entrepeneur and businessman who founded PayPal.
              He became a multi-millionaire in only his late 20's and eventually launched the first
            commercial spacecraft to the ISS in May of 2012. Today, Elon is worth Billions of dollars,
          but he's also busy helping the average american get a more economical and eco friendly ride with his Tesla's.</p>

              <p>Leonardo Da Vinci (April 15, 1452 -1519) wore many hats. He was a painter, sculptor, architect, inventor and so much more.
              To say he has hobbies would be a severe understatement, considering he was an expert as so many things. Even if you're somehow
              not familiar with him off the top of your head, you have probably heard of the most famous "Mona Lisa". One of his lesser known
            works was that he worked on a flying machine!</p>
